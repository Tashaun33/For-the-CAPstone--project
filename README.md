## Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for the Data Analytics capstone project. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly okay to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. 

as an honour student of the Code Institute its my pleasure to produce: a true guide to bring my own idea(s) to life based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.

Use a generative AI assistant to help with ideation, design thinking, and business requirements. i like Chat gpt myself.

Deliver a dashboard that meets the above requirements. im thinking of Tableau now because of ease of deployment.




You can safely delete the Template Instructions section of this README.md file and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use.
